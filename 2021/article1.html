      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microglia, 
        echinoderm, microbiomes, mealworms, exoplanets. 
        These terms may spark some sort of familiarity to you, 
        perhaps you have taken a course, listened to a presentation, or 
        are intrigued by your own research in regards to them. All of these
        terms may have been, are currently, or will be the basis for a hypothesis
        in the MARC Program, a college course-style investigative and engineering
        research two-year-long curriculum.</p>
        
        
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Some may have learned about the Marin Academy Research Collaborative 
        (MARC) while researching the school, while others may have gained
        interest when conversing with upperclassmen. Many of the students 
        I’ve met had either strong opposition or interest in participating.
        The two-year program is rather simply outlined: first, a student 
        proposes a question or hypothesis that relates to fields of engineering
        and computer sciences, life sciences, physical sciences, social 
        sciences, or psychology. The next step is to collaborate with content
        area mentors (think more advisor-type figures, and less hero’s
        journey and literary characters), novel research is carried out 
        before students debrief and write a manuscript in response to said 
        hypothesis. The students participating are also expected to make their 
        independent study the focus of their project. The course is done under 
        the supervision of an instructor and receives a pass/fail grade, and 
        despite not having any effect on a student’s GPA, I would argue that 
        no one should have anything but the utmost respect and admiration 
        for MARC students.

      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that is agreed upon by many 
        scientists is that it is learned best while actually performing 
        it. That being said, the program is not advised for everyone. The 
        leaders and founders of MARC appear to address this themselves; 
        mealworms and microbiomes aren’t for everyone after all.</p>
