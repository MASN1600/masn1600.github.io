      <h3>Dec. 16, 2021</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">This past month has been full of entertainment and excitement. 
        Whether it’s talking about the new Marvel movies or blasting “All Too Well” on a speaker, 
        pop culture is poppin’ and we’re all here for it. COVID-19 has enforced many restrictions 
        on our daily lives; however, people are beginning to return to pre-pandemic activities like
        going to concerts and movie theatres. The upcoming tours are sure to get people back in 
        the groove of enjoying live music.</p>
      <p class="article-paragraph">For many, missing out on concerts and music festivals was just 
        another negative in 2020. Now that COVID-19 restrictions are slowly being lifted, many are 
        scurrying to find concert tickets to see their favorite artists. For example, Harry Styles 
        has started his Love On Tour and is undoubtedly going to be highly successful. With his 
        already huge fanbase, this tour is sure going to get his new music more attention. His world 
        tour started in September and is going to end in late November as he promotes his hit album 
        Fine Line. Many other artists whose music production was delayed by COVID-19 are making 
        strong comebacks from 2020, such as Coldplay, Billie Eilish, Giveon, Tyler The Creator, 
        and many more.

      <p class="article-paragraph">Speaking of music and excitement, Britney Spears was finally freed
         from the conservatorship from her father. This 14-year-long legal battle ended on November 
         12, 2021. Britney’s father Jaime Spears had been controlling all of the pop star’s finances,
         medical decisions, real estate, and career without her input. The day she was freed, she 
         immediately tweeted thanking her fans, “Good God I love my fans so much it’s crazy!!! I 
         think I’m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever…” Hundreds of Britney fans were 
         outside the courtroom when they heard the news, shouting “Free Britney!” The conservatorship
         was enforced in 2008 when Jaime Spears was granted legal control over Britney because she 
         had been behaving erratically after her divorce from Kevin Federline, as there had been 
         several incidents that raised concerns about her mental health. As part of the conservatorship, 
         Britney wasn’t able to get legally married or have a baby. Finally, she is able to live her life
         freely without having to worry about approval from conservators or even worse, her own father.

      <p class="article-paragraph">Is November not entertainment-packed enough for you? Who you gonna
         call? Ghostbusters! The sequel to the infamous 1984 movie Ghostbusters has hit the top of the 
         charts as it racked up a weekend total of $40.5 million. Ghostbusters: Afterlife was directed 
         by the brilliant Jason Reitman, the son of Ivan Reitman, who wrote and directed the original 
         Ghostbusters film. It also stars many popular actors such as Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, and Finn
          Wolfhard. Afterlife is definitely the go-to film to watch with family or friends if you enjoy
           supernatural comedies.

      <p class="article-paragraph">Speaking of films everyone wants to watch, West Side Story is 
        definitely one that people are very excited about. This musical romance is based on the 
        book written by Arthur Laurents in 1957. Steven Spielberg, the director of the remake, 
        became enchanted with West Side Story during his first listen of the Broadway Cast Album.
         The film is about two teenagers of different ethnicities and backgrounds who fall in love. 
         The story is based in the 1950s in the Upper West Side of New York City which was at the 
         time a very racially diverse area. It explores the rivalry between two teenage street 
         gangs—the Jets and the Sharks. The sophisticated dance scenes, theatrical music, and 
         outstanding plot make this film a classic.

      <p class="article-paragraph">Whether you’re ready for in-person concerts or simply want to 
        watch from home, this winter there is an extensive variety of entertainment opportunities,
        all intriguing.
