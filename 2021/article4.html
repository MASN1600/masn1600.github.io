      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procrastination, 
        the bane of every student’s existence, runs rampant at Marin Academy. We all, at one time
        or another, have made a mad dash to submit an assignment on Canvas at 11:59 pm, praying 
        the clock doesn’t strike twelve, spelling our doom. Recently, The 1600 asked some students
        what advice they would appreciate most from our staff and an overwhelming number of 
        students had inquiries about methods to avoid procrastination. One student specifically
        asked,
      </p>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hi 1600, 
        I was wondering what kind of tips you have to not procrastinate and to manage your 
        time much more efficiently.”
      </p>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks,</p>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous reader.</p>
      
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 
        fantastic question that I am sure many people have. Managing your time is one of the 
        most important skills to learn in high school, and it can be the difference between 
        turning all your assignments in on time without a care in the world or stressing right
         until the last minute. Thriving in school requires an immense amount of practice and
          is incredibly challenging, especially when you have a ton of work to get done. Luckily,
           I have four different tips that could potentially help this Anonymous Reader, as well
            as anyone else reading this. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">#1 Just Start</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first
         tip may appear too obvious and basic, but I think that it is the most important skill 
         to learn. When you begin to feel stressed about homework or other commitments, just 
         start working, without worrying about the final product and how polished that thing is
          expected to become. Work can often seem more stressful and challenging than it actually
           is and once you have started, it might not actually be that bad. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">#2 A Reward System</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 
        the perfect method to help you start (and continue) doing focused work. This reward 
        system could mean setting a timer for 25 or 30 minutes where you would work nonstop 
        and get some form of reward at the end of that time. A reward could be playing with
         a pet, watching a video, or checking social media. The most difficult aspect of this 
         method is learning to go back to work after taking a short period of time off for that 
         reward.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">#3 Productivity Apps</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are a 
        fantastic way to stop one of the primary perpetrators of procrastination: your phone.  
        One app that could potentially help you is Forest. Forest is an app where you plant 
        virtual trees and set a timer for how long you want the tree to grow. Once you start 
        that timer, you can’t do anything else on your phone—or else that tree will die. Likewise, 
        you can set a break timer in between different work timers: perhaps a 25-minute focus 
        timer and then a 5-minute break. If you have tried this type of app and it doesn’t work, 
        and you still constantly get distracted by your phone or computer, you can use Screen Time 
        (a built-in function on most smartphones) to temporarily block the most problematic apps 
        during your work time.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">#4 Breaks</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth 
        and final tip is to figure out when you, personally, do your best work and don’t force 
        it if it’s simply not the best time. Oftentimes if you are doing work and don’t want to 
        continue, consider taking a five-to-ten minute break using a timer. As soon as that timer 
        is over, immediately start working again.
      </p>
      <p class="article-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, 
        there are an infinite amount of strategies to improve time management and productivity—you 
        just have to practice and commit to a plan. If you can master time management, high school 
        will be ten times easier and ten times less stressful. If you work towards that goal, you’ll 
        be rewarded later on.
