      <h2 class="article-header">By Kate Lane</h2>
      <h3 class="article-header">Dec. 16, 2021</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph"><i>With multiple highly rated restaurants located just a short walk away from 
        Marin Academy, it’s clear MA students have a lot of choices when it comes to eating 
        off-campus. To narrow down the options, we interviewed some MA students about their 
        go-to restaurants and items on the menu. Here are the favorites:
      </i></p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Johnny Doughnuts (5 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">If you’re looking for a way to start your day off on a 
        positive note, swinging by Johnny Doughnuts might do the trick. When they’re looking 
        for a snack during their Friday free blocks,  Noa F. ‘24 and her friends often choose 
        Johnny Doughnuts. According to Johnny Doughnuts’ website, their legendary doughnuts are 
        “wholesome, handcrafted, [and] made with love.” While they offer classic doughnut flavors 
        like chocolate, they also offer rotating seasonal flavors and unique options such as lime
         poppy seed. Additionally, they serve Equator coffee and a selection of teas.
        </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Café del Soul (6 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">A mere six minute walk from campus, it is obvious why Café 
        del Soul is so well-liked amongst Marin Academy students. The restaurant features great 
        vibes and even better food. Café del Soul is Alex H. ‘24’s favorite local restaurant, 
        because she enjoys “the vibes, ambience, and location.” In particular, she recommends 
        the Kindness Bowl with chicken off the kid’s menu, and the Yogi Tea.

      <h3 class="article-header">Tenders Tenders (8 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">Tenders Tenders is another nearby restaurant serving some of 
        the best chicken tenders around. When you order, you have the choice between crispy and 
        crunchy tenders. Greta B. ‘24 recommends you try the crunchy because “they are just 
        superior,” while Devon G. ‘24 and Zac R. ‘24 prefer the crispy, because they do not have 
        seeds. Another beloved aspect of Tenders Tenders is the ambiance. Sam K. ‘23 enjoys the 
        fact that it is a small restaurant, where you can sit with people you might not know as 
        well. However, since this restaurant is so popular, it is often very crowded during lunch. 
        The safest way to be sure your food comes quickly is to order online ahead of time.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Amici’s East Coast Pizzeria (8 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">For the last 34 years, Amici’s East Coast Pizzeria has 
        been serving guests traditional New England-inspired pizza with Italian roots. They 
        are most famous for their “crisp, airy, and slightly chewy” crusts that are baked in 
        a brick oven to create an authentic Italian taste. Also known for their colorful salads 
        and mouth-watering pastas, Amici’s is a favorite for students of all grade levels. Noa 
        F. ‘24 says, “Amici’s has been my family’s favorite pizza place ever since we were little.”
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Crepevine (9 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">Crepevine is one of the most popular restaurants among 
        many MA students, and offers a wide range of food and drink options. While they 
        specialize in crepes, they let you choose from a long menu, which includes drinks, 
        pancakes, and various lunch and dinner options. “They have good food and chai lattes,” 
        according to Greta B. ‘24. The sweet crepes, served with whipped cream and vanilla ice 
        cream, are also popular among MA students. Students often swing by during morning free 
        blocks and lunch to pick up crepes like the Siena sweet crepe, which is filled with 
        nutella, chocolate sauce, strawberries, and nuts.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Aroma Cafe (10 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">Aroma has arguably earned its spot as the most well-liked 
        cafe near MA. Since it is a laid-back environment, it is easy to grab a bite to eat and 
        simultaneously get some homework done. According to Sam K. ‘23, “They have incredibly 
        good coffee cake, and an amazing atmosphere.” Julia S. ‘22 agrees, noting that one 
        excellent choice on the menu is the caprese sandwich.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article-header">Arizmendi Bakery (11 minute walk)</h3>
      <p class="article-paragraph">A worker-owned bakery, Arizmendi prides itself on using 
        high-quality ingredients in their freshly baked pastries, pizza, sandwiches, and more. 
        Lucy S. ‘24 loves Arizmendi because “the vibes are so cute, the bread is amazing, [and] 
        it’s all sustainably produced.” Rex R. ‘25 agrees, but he also notes, “It takes slightly 
        longer than other restaurants,” so it may be a better choice for free blocks or on the days 
        we have tutorial before lunch.
